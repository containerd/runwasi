# containerd-shim-wasm

A library to help build containerd shims for Wasm workloads.

## Usage

To implement a shim, simply implement the `Engine` trait:

```rust,no_run
use containerd_shim_wasm::{
    revision, shim_main, version,
    container::{Engine, RuntimeContext},
    Config,
};
use anyhow::Result;

#[derive(Clone, Default)]
struct MyEngine;

impl Engine for MyEngine {
    fn name() -> &'static str {
        "my-engine"
    }

    fn run_wasi(&self, ctx: &impl RuntimeContext) -> Result<i32> {
        // Implement your Wasm runtime logic here
        Ok(0)
    }
}

shim_main::<MyEngine>(
    "my-engine",
    version!(),
    revision!(),
    "v1",
    None,
);
```

The `Engine` trait provides optional methods you can override:

- `can_handle()` - Validates that the runtime can run the container (checks Wasm file headers by default)
- `supported_layers_types()` - Returns supported OCI layer types 
- `precompile()` - Allows precompilation of Wasm modules
- `can_precompile()` - Indicates if the runtime supports precompilation

The resulting shim uses [Youki](https://github.com/youki-dev/youki)'s `libcontainer` crate to manage the container lifecycle, such as creating the container, starting it, and deleting it, and youki handles container sandbox for you.

### Running the shim

containerd expects the shim binary to be installed into `$PATH` (as seen by the containerd process) with a binary name like `containerd-shim-myshim-v1` which maps to the `io.containerd.myshim.v1` runtime. It can be [configured in containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/core/runtime/v2/README.md#configuring-runtimes).

This crate is not tied to any specific wasm engine.
