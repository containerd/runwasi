# We are not including the `async` feature here:
# 1. Because we don't even use it
# 2. Because it pulls in a lot of dependencies that we don't need
# 3. Because that dependency (wasmtime-fiber) links to native code
# 4. The wasmedge shim also uses wasmtime-fiber... which means those transative dependencies need to be the same or compilation fails
